      <description>If you followed along with our introduction to Docker, ROS, and overlay networking you&amp;rsquo;ll have a couple of machines (at least) in a Swarm, and an overlay network called botnet which is all ready to go.
For the next part, we&amp;rsquo;re going to hook up a Beaglebone Black with four Dynamixels attached via a USB2AX controller, then control it remotely. Whilst this is pretty specific requirements-wise, these instructions will also generalise fairly well to other platforms – Raspberry Pi for instance – with only a bit of tinkering.</description>

      <description>Here at the institute we&amp;rsquo;re busy building our own take on cloud robotics, about which you can read more [here]. For this we need an approach that scales well to multiple subsystems, with differing OS requirements – from remote data processing on GPU accelerated hardware, to embedded motor control. To this end we&amp;rsquo;ve settled on a combination of the open-source Robot Operating System ROS, and an overlay network (enabled using Docker Swarm) to link each subcomponent into a single &amp;lsquo;distributed robot&amp;rsquo;.</description>
